### Deleting Files Using CMD
If you want to delete a file using **Command Prompt (CMD)**, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Open Command Prompt
- Press **Windows + R**, type `cmd`, and press **Enter**.

#### Step 2: Navigate to the Directory of the File
Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where the file you want to delete is located. For example:

```bash
cd C:\Users\Username\Documents
```

#### Step 3: Delete the File
To delete a specific file, use the `del` command followed by the file name. For example, to delete the file `fileku.txt`:

```bash
del fileku.txt
```

If the file is located in a folder that requires administrator permission, make sure to run CMD as **Administrator**.

#### Delete All Files of a Specific Type
If you want to delete all files of a certain type within the directory, use a wildcard (`*`). For example, to delete all `.txt` files:

```bash
del *.txt
```

#### Delete a Folder (Directory)
To delete a folder and its contents, use the `rmdir` or `rd` command. For example, to delete the `folderku` directory:

```bash
rmdir /s /q folderku
```

The `/s` flag deletes the folder and all its contents, and `/q` forces deletion without asking for confirmation.

## Notes
- **Deleting files in CMD is permanent** and they are not moved to the Recycle Bin.
- **Be cautious when deleting files** to avoid losing important data.
